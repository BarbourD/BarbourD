  <h3>About Me</h3>
<p> Hello my name is David Barbour and I am a software engineer. I am currently completing a full-stack bootcamp at General Assembly in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Python and Django. What excites me most about diving into a new career as a software engineer are the challenges and the nonstop education. One of my favorite things about learning is the ability to pass that knowledge on to others. Throughout my life as a dance teacher and a sales trainer I have always found the exchange of ideas and initiation of new connections to be the most rewarding. What I hope to get out of a life in software engineering; is sharing, knowledge, and the creation of amazing things. </p>
  
  <h3>Currently Learning</h3>
